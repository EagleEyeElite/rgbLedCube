my mistakes:
- I tested the leds just with 3V / multimeter without checking volt threspoint
- didnt test with tlc controller, some leds dont light up

also: to stop a led from lighing also the led above, i used black paint at the bottom of the led

current PCB has some flaws: checkout board/notes/specs & mistakes.md
